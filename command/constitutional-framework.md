# Constitutional Framework Creation

I'll help you create a comprehensive constitutional framework for your project that establishes governing principles, standards, and values.

## Process

1. **Analyze Project Requirements**: Understanding the project's purpose, technology stack, and goals
2. **Define Core Principles**: Establishing fundamental values for development and operations
3. **Create Technical Standards**: Defining code quality, security, performance, and accessibility requirements
4. **Establish Quality Gates**: Setting up validation checkpoints and compliance requirements
5. **Generate Documentation**: Creating comprehensive constitutional documentation

## What I'll Create

- `/CONSTITUTION.md` - Complete constitutional framework document
- `constitutional_checks.yml` - Automated compliance validation configuration
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Spec-Kit integrated constitutional document
- Constitutional compliance scripts and validation tools

## Constitutional Framework Components

- **Core Principles**: Privacy, security, quality, performance, accessibility
- **Technical Standards**: TypeScript strict mode, test coverage, security requirements
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit, pre-push, CI/CD validation requirements
- **Governance**: Review processes, compliance monitoring, continuous improvement

## Integration

- OpenCode agent system constitutional validation
- Spec-Kit workflow integration with constitutional checks
- Copilot-CLI constitutional standards enforcement
- Automated compliance monitoring and reporting

Please provide:

1. Project name and description
2. Primary technology stack
3. Key security or compliance requirements
4. Performance or scalability targets
5. Any existing standards or frameworks to align with

I'll then create a comprehensive constitutional framework tailored to your project's needs.
