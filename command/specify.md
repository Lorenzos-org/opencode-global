Create functional specifications using Spec-Driven Development methodology:

## Specification Focus:
- Define **what** to build (not **how**)
- Focus on user stories and functional requirements
- Include acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Document constraints and assumptions
- Specify user interactions and workflows

## Process:
1. Gather and clarify requirements
2. Define user stories with acceptance criteria
3. Document functional specifications
4. Identify edge cases and constraints
5. Create validation checklists

## Output:
Creates/updates `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/spec.md` with comprehensive functional specifications.
