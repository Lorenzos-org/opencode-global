# Constitutional Compliance Validation

I'll validate the current changes against the project's constitutional requirements.

## Validation Process

1. **Check Constitutional Framework**: Verify constitutional documents exist and are current
2. **Analyze Changes**: Review code changes for constitutional compliance
3. **Run Automated Checks**: Execute constitutional validation scripts
4. **Generate Report**: Create comprehensive compliance report

## Constitutional Checks

- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, linting, test coverage
- **Security**: Input validation, authentication, data protection
- **Performance**: Response times, bundle sizes, Core Web Vitals
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Documentation**: Completeness and accuracy
- **Testing**: Coverage and quality requirements

## What I'll Do

1. Execute constitutional compliance validation script
2. Analyze any violations or warnings
3. Provide recommendations for improvements
4. Generate constitutional compliance report

## Output

- Constitutional compliance status
- List of any violations or warnings
- Recommendations for constitutional improvements
- Compliance report for the changes
