Create technical implementation plans using Spec-Driven Development methodology:

## Planning Focus:
- Define technical architecture and tech stack
- Create implementation strategy and approach
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Plan data models and API design
- Consider performance and security requirements

## Process:
1. Analyze functional specifications
2. Choose appropriate technology stack
3. Design system architecture
4. Plan component structure and dependencies
5. Create implementation roadmap
6. Identify risks and mitigation strategies

## Output:
Creates/updates `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/plan.md` with detailed technical implementation plan.
