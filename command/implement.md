description: Execute implementation tasks systematically according to plan
agent: build
subtask: true

Execute implementation using Spec-Driven Development methodology:

## Implementation Focus:
- Execute tasks in correct order
- Respect dependencies and parallel markers
- Follow technical specifications exactly
- Implement test-driven development when specified
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Maintain code quality standards

## Process:
1. Validate all prerequisites (constitution, spec, plan, tasks)
2. Parse task breakdown from tasks.md
3. Execute tasks respecting dependencies
4. Provide progress updates
5. Handle errors and adjustments
6. Validate implementation against specifications

## Output:
Executes all tasks systematically to build the feature according to specifications and plan.
