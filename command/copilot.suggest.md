# Copilot Suggest Command

## Purpose
Delivers AI-assisted architecture suggestions while validating constitutional standards compliance, ensuring security guidelines adherence, and integrating quality assurance principles.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Context Analysis
- Analyze project requirements and constraints
- Review existing architectural decisions
- Assess constitutional standards applicability
- Evaluate security requirements and guidelines
- Understand quality assurance expectations

### Step 2: Architecture Pattern Analysis
- Identify suitable architectural patterns
- Evaluate pattern compliance with constitutional principles
- Assess security implications of architectural choices
- Validate quality assurance integration points
- Consider maintainability and scalability requirements

### Step 3: Constitutional Standards Validation
- Validate suggested architecture against constitutional standards
- Ensure governance principles are embedded in design
- Check stakeholder engagement requirements
- Verify decision-making process alignment
- Assess transparency and accountability mechanisms

### Step 4: Security Guidelines Compliance
- Analyze security architecture recommendations
- Validate security control integration
- Check compliance with security standards
- Assess threat model alignment
- Verify security testing and validation approaches

### Step 5: Quality Assurance Integration
- Integrate quality metrics and standards
- Validate testing strategy alignment
- Assess performance requirements compliance
- Check maintainability standards
- Verify documentation completeness

### Step 6: Suggestion Generation & Presentation
- Generate comprehensive architecture suggestions
- Present constitutional compliance analysis
- Document security considerations
- Provide quality assurance integration points
- Create implementation roadmap with validation checkpoints

## Input Requirements
- Project requirements and constraints
- Constitutional standards documentation
- Security guidelines and requirements
- Quality assurance frameworks
- Existing architectural decisions
- Technical constraints and preferences

## Output Artifacts
- AI-assisted architecture recommendations
- Constitutional compliance validation report
- Security guidelines compliance assessment
- Quality assurance integration plan
