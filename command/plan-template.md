# Plan Command

## Usage
```
/speckit.plan [prompt]
```

## Description
Creates comprehensive technical implementation plans based on the current specification. This command focuses on the "how" of the system, defining technology stack, architecture, and implementation strategy.

## Process
1. Reviews current specification and constitution
2. Analyzes technology requirements and constraints
3. Designs system architecture and component structure
4. Defines implementation phases and milestones
5. Creates performance optimization strategies
6. Establishes security and quality measures

## Examples
```
/speckit.plan Use Python 3.14 with llama.cpp, FAISS, and sentence-transformers for a high-performance RAG system
/speckit.plan Design a modular architecture with separate components for document processing, embeddings, and LLM inference
/speckit.plan Create an implementation plan optimized for macOS with Metal acceleration and local processing
```

## Output
- Technical architecture documentation
- Technology stack specifications
- Implementation phases and timelines
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security and quality assurance plans
- Component design and integration details

## Integration
Technical plans are used by:
- `/speckit.tasks` for detailed task breakdown
- `/speckit.implement` for systematic implementation
- `/speckit.analyze` for architecture validation
- Quality gates for technical standard compliance
