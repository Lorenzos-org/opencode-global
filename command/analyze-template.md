# Analyze Command

## Usage
```
/speckit.analyze
```

## Description
Performs comprehensive cross-artifact consistency and coverage analysis across all specification documents. This command validates alignment between constitution, specification, technical plan, and task breakdown.

## Process
1. Loads all specification artifacts
2. Performs consistency cross-checks
3. Analyzes requirement coverage completeness
4. Validates task dependency correctness
5. Assesses technical plan feasibility
6. Generates analysis report with recommendations

## Features
- **Consistency Analysis**: Validates alignment across all artifacts
- **Coverage Analysis**: Ensures complete requirement coverage
- **Dependency Validation**: Checks task breakdown correctness
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Evaluates technical plan viability
- **Gap Identification**: Identifies missing or inconsistent elements

## Output
- Comprehensive analysis report
- Consistency gap identification
- Coverage completeness assessment
- Dependency validation results
- Recommendations for improvements

## Integration
Analysis results inform:
- Specification refinement priorities
- Technical plan adjustments
- Task breakdown corrections
- Quality checklist updates
- Implementation risk assessment
