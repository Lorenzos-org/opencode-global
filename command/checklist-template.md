# Checklist Command

## Usage
```
/speckit.checklist
```

## Description
Generates custom quality checklists that validate requirements completeness, clarity, and consistency. This command creates "unit tests for English" to ensure specification quality before implementation.

## Process
1. Analyzes current specification artifacts
2. Generates requirement-specific checklist items
3. Creates validation criteria for each requirement
4. Establishes quality gates and acceptance criteria
5. Produces actionable checklist with validation methods

## Features
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensures all requirements are testable
- **Clarity Assessment**: Validates requirement clarity and specificity
- **Consistency Checking**: Ensures no contradictions across artifacts
- **Testability Analysis**: Verifies requirements can be validated
- **Quality Gates**: Creates acceptance criteria for implementation

## Output
- Custom quality checklist document
- Requirement validation criteria
- Testability assessment results
- Quality gate definitions
- Implementation readiness evaluation

## Integration
Quality checklists are used for:
- Pre-implementation requirement validation
- Specification quality assurance
- Implementation readiness assessment
- Quality gate enforcement
- Team review and validation processes
