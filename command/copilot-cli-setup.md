# Copilot-CLI Constitutional Configuration Setup

I'll help you configure Copilot-CLI with constitutional standards validation for enhanced code assistance.

## Constitutional Copilot-CLI Setup Process

1. **Install Copilot-CLI**: Set up the Copilot CLI tool with constitutional validation
2. **Configure Constitutional Standards**: Integrate constitutional requirements into Copilot workflows
3. **Setup Validation Hooks**: Add constitutional compliance checking to Copilot operations
4. **Create Custom Commands**: Configure constitutional-compliant Copilot commands
5. **Integration Testing**: Test Copilot-CLI integration with constitutional validation

## Constitutional Standards Integration

### Security Standards for Copilot-CLI

- **Input Validation**: All Copilot-generated code must pass constitutional security validation
- **Authentication**: Copilot suggestions must follow constitutional authentication patterns
- **Data Protection**: Generated code must include constitutional data protection measures
- **Vulnerability Prevention**: Copilot suggestions must prevent OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

### Performance Standards for Copilot-CLI

- **Optimization**: Copilot suggestions must meet constitutional performance requirements
- **Bundle Size**: Generated code must respect constitutional bundle size limits
- **Response Times**: Code suggestions must support constitutional response time targets
- **Scalability**: Generated solutions must be scalable per constitutional requirements

### Quality Standards for Copilot-CLI

- **TypeScript Strict**: All Copilot code must pass constitutional TypeScript strict mode
- **Test Coverage**: Copilot suggestions must include constitutional test requirements
- **Documentation**: Generated code must include constitutional documentation standards
- **Code Quality**: Copilot output must meet constitutional code quality metrics

### Accessibility Standards for Copilot-CLI

- **WCAG Compliance**: Copilot suggestions must meet constitutional WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Generated UI code must support constitutional keyboard navigation
- **Screen Reader**: Copilot output must be screen reader compatible per constitutional standards
- **Color Contrast**: Generated designs must meet constitutional color contrast requirements

## Constitutional Copilot Configuration

### Copilot-CLI Constitutional Configuration File

I'll create a constitutional configuration that ensures all Copilot suggestions meet constitutional requirements:

```json
{
  "constitutional_standards": {
    "enabled": true,
    "security_requirements": {
      "input_validation": true,
      "authentication_patterns": true,
      "data_encryption": true,
      "vulnerability_prevention": true
    },
    "performance_requirements": {
      "response_time_optimization": true,
      "bundle_size_limits": true,
      "core_web_vitals": true,
      "scalability_patterns": true
    },
    "quality_requirements": {
      "typescript_strict": true,
      "test_coverage_minimum": 85,
      "documentation_required": true,
      "code_complexity_limits": true
    },
    "accessibility_requirements": {
      "wcag_compliance": "2.1 AA",
      "keyboard_navigation": true,
      "screen_reader_support": true,
      "color_contrast_validation": true
    }
  },
  "validation_hooks": {
    "pre_suggestion": "constitutional-compliance-check",
    "post_generation": "constitutional-quality-assurance",
    "integration_testing": "constitutional-integration-validation"
  },
  "suggestion_filters": {
    "security_patterns": "require-constitutional-security",
    "performance_patterns": "require-constitutional-performance",
    "quality_patterns": "require-constitutional-quality",
    "accessibility_patterns": "require-constitutional-accessibility"
  }
}
```

### Constitutional Command Configuration

I'll create constitutional-compliant Copilot commands:

- **/copilot.suggest**: Enhanced with constitutional validation
- **/copilot.review**: Constitutional code quality assessment
- **/copilot.security**: Constitutional security review
- **/copilot.performance**: Constitutional performance optimization
- **/copilot.accessibility**: Constitutional accessibility validation

### Integration with OpenCode System

- **Agent Coordination**: Copilot-CLI integrated with @review and @developer agents
- **Constitutional Validation**: All Copilot suggestions validated against constitutional framework
- **Quality Gates**: Constitutional compliance required for Copilot-generated code
- **Audit Trail**: Copilot interactions logged in constitutional audit trail

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Copilot-CLI

```bash
# Install Copilot CLI with constitutional validation
npm install -g @github/copilot-cli
```

### Step 2: Configure Constitutional Standards

```bash
# Initialize Copilot with constitutional configuration
copilot auth
copilot config set constitutional-validation enabled
copilot config set constitutional-standards strict
```

### Step 3: Setup Validation Integration

```bash
# Configure constitutional validation hooks
copilot config set pre-commit-hook constitutional-compliance
copilot config set post-generation-hook constitutional-quality-check
```

### Step 4: Test Constitutional Integration

```bash
# Test constitutional compliance validation
copilot test constitutional-integration
copilot validate constitutional-standards
```

## Constitutional Quality Assurance

### Pre-Suggestion Validation

Before providing suggestions, Copilot-CLI will:

- Validate user intent against constitutional requirements
- Check for constitutional compliance patterns
- Ensure suggestions align with constitutional framework

### Post-Generation Validation

After generating code, Copilot-CLI will:

- Run constitutional compliance validation
- Check security, performance, and quality standards
- Validate accessibility requirements
- Generate constitutional compliance report

### Continuous Monitoring

Copilot-CLI will continuously:

- Monitor constitutional compliance trends
- Update suggestion patterns based on constitutional feedback
- Improve constitutional validation accuracy
- Report constitutional compliance metrics

## Constitutional Integration Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: All Copilot suggestions meet constitutional security standards
- **Performance Optimization**: Generated code optimized for constitutional performance targets
- **Quality Assurance**: Constitutional quality gates ensure high code quality
- **Accessibility Compliance**: All UI suggestions meet constitutional accessibility requirements
- **Consistent Standards**: Constitutional framework ensures consistent code patterns

## Next Steps

1. Install Copilot-CLI with constitutional validation
2. Configure constitutional standards and validation hooks
3. Test integration with existing OpenCode + Spec-Kit workflows
4. Train team on constitutional Copilot-CLI usage
5. Monitor constitutional compliance and optimize suggestions

I'll guide you through the complete Copilot-CLI constitutional configuration process.
