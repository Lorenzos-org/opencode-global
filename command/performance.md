description: Analyze application performance
agent: performance-optimizer
subtask: true

Analyze application performance and identify optimization opportunities:

Build and profile: !`npm run build`

Performance analysis areas:
- Bundle size optimization opportunities
- Algorithm efficiency improvements
- Memory usage patterns and leaks
- Database query optimization
- Network request optimization
- Caching strategies
- Rendering performance
- Asset optimization

Performance optimization process:
1. Profile current performance metrics
2. Identify bottlenecks and hotspots
3. Analyze bundle composition and size
4. Review database queries and indexing
5. Check for memory leaks or excessive allocations
6. Evaluate caching effectiveness
7. Test optimization impact

Provide:
- Performance baseline measurements
- Specific optimization recommendations
- Before/after comparisons when possible
- Implementation priority based on impact
- Trade-off considerations

Use todowrite to track performance investigations and optimization tasks.
