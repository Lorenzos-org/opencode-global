Generate task breakdowns using Spec-Driven Development methodology:

## Task Breakdown Focus:
- Convert implementation plan into actionable tasks
- Organize tasks by user story and dependency
- Mark parallel execution opportunities
- Define file paths and deliverables
- Include testing and validation tasks
- Create checkpoints and milestones

## Process:
1. Analyze technical implementation plan
2. Break down into sequential tasks
3. Identify parallel execution opportunities
4. Define task dependencies and order
5. Create validation checkpoints
6. Estimate effort and complexity

## Output:
Creates/updates `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/tasks.md` with detailed task breakdown.

Use todowrite to track task execution and progress.
