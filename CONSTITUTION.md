# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Constitutional Compliance
- All development must comply with constitutional standards
- Constitutional validation is required for all changes
- Audit trails must be maintained for constitutional compliance
- Constitutional checks are integrated into all workflows

### 2. Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
- All features must be specified before implementation
- Specifications must be validated against constitutional standards
- Implementation must follow approved specifications
- Changes to specifications require constitutional review

### 3. Quality Standards
- Code must pass all quality gates before merging
- Security validation is mandatory for all changes
- Performance standards must be maintained
- Documentation must be kept current

### 4. Agent-Based Development
- All agents must comply with constitutional standards
- Agent operations must be auditable
- Agent configurations must follow constitutional guidelines
- Agent synchronization requires constitutional validation

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Specification
- Create specifications using spec-kit templates
- Validate specifications against constitutional standards
- Review and approve specifications
- Archive approved specifications

### Phase 2: Implementation
- Implement according to approved specifications
- Maintain constitutional compliance during development
- Run continuous constitutional validation
- Update documentation

### Phase 3: Validation
- Run comprehensive test suites
- Perform constitutional compliance checks
- Validate security requirements
- Verify performance standards

### Phase 4: Integration
- Validate integration with existing systems
- Perform constitutional audit
- Update documentation
- Deploy with constitutional validation

## Constitutional Requirements

### Documentation Standards
- All changes must be documented
- Documentation must meet constitutional standards
- Constitutional compliance must be documented
- Audit trails must be maintained

### Code Quality
- All code must pass linting and formatting
- Type checking is mandatory
- Security scanning is required
- Performance testing must be performed

### Git Workflow
- Conventional commit messages are required
- All commits must pass constitutional validation
- Branch protection must be maintained
- Merge requests require constitutional review

## Compliance Validation

### Automated Checks
- Constitutional compliance is validated automatically
- Quality gates are enforced
- Security scanning is continuous
- Performance monitoring is active

### Manual Review

## Constitutional Audit

### Audit Requirements
- All changes must be auditable
- Constitutional compliance must be tracked
- Violations must be documented
- Remediation plans must be created

### Audit Trail
